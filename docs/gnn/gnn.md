## Residual or Gate? Towards Deeper Graph Neural: Networks for Inductive Graph Representation Learning *2019*
[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08035.pdf)
### Features 
* For both GAT and GCN, LSTM/GRU is better than res


## Reference
[Introduction blog with interaction graph](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/): 
    * Very clear explaination and well summarized points.
    * As design tipps: comparision with different layers, feature dimensions, aggregation method
    * Less parameters (~10k), less layer(~2), sum aggregation, relatively larger feature size, more types of features (edge, node, global) are good.
    * GAT (attentation)
