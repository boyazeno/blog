# Cron in Linux
## What is this
In linux, cron will start defined jobs at given time periods. Jobs could be defined by each user themselves. 

To see the service status:
```sh
sudo systemctl status cron.service
```

Cron save the jobs to be executed in several path, some of them are:
`cracklib/`,
`cron.daily`,
`cron.monthly`,
`cron.weekly`,
`cron.d`,
`cron.hourly`,
`crontab`

## How-To
* List cron jobs for current user:

```sh
crontab -l
```

* Add jobs for current user 
```sh
crontab -e
```
* For each command, a time will be written in the front.

```sh
# 0-59 min, 0-23 hour, 1-31 day, 1-12 month, 0-6 week-day. * for all time
* * * * * command-to-be-executed 
```

## Notice
For some linux version, cron were used for privilege escalation attack. 

Attacker will navigate to `/etc/cron.d` folder and use the core dump file generated by the attack program in this folder as an attack job to execute command with sudo privilege.
